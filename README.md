# GrassRoots

Elevating Civic Engagement 

Developed by Mohamed Ben-Rabaa, Caroline Kang, Talha Rahman and Robert Zarate-Morales

Our key objective is to bring the power back into the hands of concerned citizens. 
Currently, a lot of the information revolving around the work of our elected officials live fragmented both online and offline.

Grassroots significantly reduces the gap between the users and those in or seeking office. 
We help users create petitions, connect with representatives, and view their vote positions and office expenses. 
Our aim is to provide transparency and demand a higher level of accountability.
